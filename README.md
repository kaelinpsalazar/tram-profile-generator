    <h1>Team Profile Generator</h1>
    <h2>## Description</h2>
    <p>This is a javascript application that gets information from the user 
about team which can contain a manager,a intern, or an engineer. It prompts for different information, depending  
upon which type of employee is being asked about. Once the information is gathered, the application creates a card
 that containes the information gathered and produces an html page.</p>
    <h2>## How to install</h2>
    <p> Download the code, run an npm i, and use node index.js to kick off the
 app.</p>
    <h2>## How to use</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>## What are the contributers?</h2>
    <p>I used bootstrap for building the cards, jest for the tests, and then
 in order to run the prompts I used inquirer.</p>
